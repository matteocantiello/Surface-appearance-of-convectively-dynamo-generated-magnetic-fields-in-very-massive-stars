\begin{enumerate}
\item Threshold (M,Z,V=0,0.4)
\item Spindown timescale (as function of (M,Z,V=0,0.4)
\item Uncertainties: massloss, critical rotation, initial rotation, core overshoot, rotational mixing, core-envelope coupling initial $\omega$ distribution  
\item Model for dynamo
\item Model for exponential decay in the radiative zone
\item Kippenhanhs $B_{eq}$
\item Kipphenhans $Ro$
\item Impact of following evolution
\item Impact on SN progenitors (pair instability, typeII-I)
\item Impact on compact remnants. Magnetars. BHs 
\item In binary stars: impact on GRBs etc.
\item Impact on mass loss / Aspherical Nebulae
